# Note Taking App

This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes. 

I built this application using an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## Usage 

1. Go to my deployed app on Heroku - https://note-taking-chad.herokuapp.com/
2. Type in the title of the note and a text body
3. Save the note by pressing the save icon in the top left
4. Delete saved notes by clicking on the red trash button next to the note
